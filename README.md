Personal Expense Tracker

Project Goal: Build a command-line application that helps users track their daily expenses and analyze spending patterns.
Core Features to Implement:

1. Add Expenses

    Prompt user for expense amount and description
    Save expenses with timestamps to a CSV file

2. View Expenses

    Display all expenses or filter by date range
    Show expenses by category
    Format output in a readable table

3. Spending Analysis

    Calculate total spending for different time periods (daily, weekly, monthly)
    Show spending breakdown by category with percentages
    Find the highest and lowest expenses

4. Data Persistence

    Save all data to a CSV file that persists between program runs
    Load existing data when the program starts

Technical Skills They'll Practice:

    File I/O operations (reading/writing CSV files)
    Data structures (lists, dictionaries)
    String formatting and user input handling
    Date/time manipulation with the datetime module
    Basic data analysis and calculations
    Error handling for invalid inputs
    Menu-driven program structure

Bonus Challenges:

    Add expense categories validation
    Implement expense editing/deletion
    Create simple data visualizations with matplotlib
    Add budget limits with warnings when exceeded
